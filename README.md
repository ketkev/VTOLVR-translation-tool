# How to download

You can download this tool by going to [this link](https://github.com/ketkev/VTOLVR-translation-tool/releases). The download will be under the "assets" dropdown.

If you don't know which to download, the 64-bit version is a safe bet these days. If that doesn't work, try the 32-bit version.

# Why is it so big?

All the necessary dependencies are packed into the .exe, therefor you don't have to have a specific version of .NET installed.
