# VTOLVR-translation-tool

A small tool to help ease the translation of VTOL VR. Instructions on how to use this program can be found [here!](#how-to-use)

# How to download

You can download this tool by going to [this link](https://github.com/ketkev/VTOLVR-translation-tool/releases). The download will be under the "assets" dropdown.

If you don't know which to download, the 64-bit version is a safe bet these days. If that doesn't work, try the 32-bit version.

## Help I got this scary warning

![Example of Windows smartscreen warning](https://i.imgur.com/tLVVnpP.png)

If you got a warning like this, there is nothing to worry about. This is because I can't spend â‚¬ 500+ on a certificate. Until I do this, Windows will nag everyone trying to use this software.

If you click on "<ins>More info</ins>", two buttons will appear which allow you to run the program anyways

# How to use

This section will assume you already have untranslated `.csv` files. If you don't have them, check the official VTOL VR discord.

To use this tool, simply drop the `.exe` into the folder with your translation files. The tool will automatically detect these when you start the tool.

I hope the rest of this tool is straight forward to use. If not, feel free to contact me on Discord at Ketkev#0001

# Why is it so big?

All the necessary dependencies are packed into the .exe, therefor you don't have to have a specific version of .NET installed.
